Abstract
The productivity of a Cement Industrial Plant is lower than it should be because
the Corp. experiences crisises in their blast furnace. This happens when the
temperature of the hot metal in its furnace dips lower than the allotted range
of 1400 to 1500 degrees Celsius. To remedy this situation the workers of the
Steel Plant increase the inputs to the furnace as soon as the crisis begins and
wait a few hours until the hot metal temperature increases to resume steel
production. Trying to prevent these crisises, the blast furnace of the Steel
Corp. has been modeled as a neural network. This paper shows how
inverting this network and providing it with a given output/hot metal
temperature produces the required inputs/amount of the inputs to the blast
furnace which are needed to have that output. Inverting neural networks
produces a one to many mapping so the problem must be modeled as an
optimization problem, which needs to be minimized. Solving this
optimization problem produces the desired inputs, but this paper shows the
results are not perfect and there are errors associated with. Therefore the
inversion problem is successfully solved when it is minimized but there are
other studies, which must be conducted to try to reduce the error associated
with the result and even find alternative methods to the problem.
